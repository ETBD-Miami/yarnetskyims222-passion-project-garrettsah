            <p>The Crucible is a competitive player-vs-player (PvP) multiplayer activity in Destiny 2. Players can earn loot by completing Crucible matches.[1] However, in order to be eligible for rewards, a player must have obtained at least one kill. In most playlists, Light and Power advantages are disabled, so all players have a chance regardless of their or their opponents' levels. However, there is a Crucible rank, which goes up only if you play Crucible. It allows you to unlock cool rewards from Lord Shaxx, who heads all Crucible activities.</p>
            <p>The Crucible offers multiple different game modes. Here's a quick breakdown of the main ones:
            </p>
            <h2>Control</h2>
            <p>This game mode is centered around zone control. Upon spawning in, one can notice that there are three zones (A, B, and C). It is the two opposing teams' goal to capture all three zones at once so that they may gain what's called a "power play". Whilst a power play is active, kills by your team have an increased score for your team. Essentially, the goal of this game mode is to kill the opposing team, but capturing all of the zones and then killing the opposition grants your team more points.</p>
            <h2>Rumble</h2>
            <p>Rumble is a fairly easy to understand game mode. It is a six player free-for-all, meaning there are no teams, and you must kill anyone you see. The goal of Rumble is to be the first to reach 2,500 points. Each kill is 100 points, plus another 50 if you kill whoever's in first place.</p>
            <h2>Survival</h2>
            <p>Survival is different because rather than bringing up your Crucible rank, it brings up your Glory rank. Your Glory rank is a competitive ranking system, meaning it can go up or down based on your performance in Survival, and it also matches you with similarly ranked players. The better you perform, the tougher the opposition will be. Regarding the game mode itself, Survival is a 3-on-3 team deathmatch, and each team only gets 4 respawns per round. The first team to win 4 rounds wins the match.</p>
            <h2>Iron Banner</h2>
            <p>Iron Banner is a similar game mode to Control with a few little differences. It is a monthly week-long event, and in it, your power level matters. If you have a higher power level, you can deal more damage and take less. If you are of a lower power level, you deal less damage and are more susceptible to it. Furthermore, rather than the power play, there is "the hunt". When a team captures all three zones, those zones lock for a short period, and kills by that team grant significantly more points. Iron Banner puts a much heavier emphasis on capturing the zones.
            </p>
            <h2>Trials of Osiris</h2>
            <p>Trials of Osiris is very similar to Survival, but it is much more competitive. It is only available on the weekends, and players must have reached a certain power level to gain access to it. Trials also has its own ranking system, giving you Trials-exclusive rewards as you rank up. Once you reach that power level, you have to talk to Saint-14, the officiator of Trials, and obtain Trials Passage. Those passages track your wins, and if you get 7 wins straight, you have gone "flawless", which grants you access to the Lighthouse. The Lighthouse has a chest that you can open to get some sick rewards, including that week's "adept" weapon. There are 4 different types of Trials Passages:</p>
            <p>Passage of Mercy - forgives one loss per run.</p>
            <p>Passage of Ferocity - grants a bonus win if you get your first three without losing.</p>
            <p>Passage of Confidence - gives you bonus rewards from the flawless chest in the Lighthouse.</p>
            <p>Passage of Wealth - increases Trials rank points every 3rd, 5th, and 7th win.</p>
