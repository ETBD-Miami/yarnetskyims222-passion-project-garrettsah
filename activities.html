                <p>Within the Destiny 2 universe, there are multiple different activities you can take part in. Save the galaxy from evil alien forces, go head to head with friends, or compete to earn greater rewards. The possibilities are endless, and you'll never get bored!</p>

            <h1>Campaign</h1>
            <p>Destiny 2 has over 50 campaign missions, each picking up at a different point of the storyline. The Cosmodrome will be the first place you go to for your first mission for those new to the game. You’ll get a new weapon and will take out a Spider Tank. After you finish the first mission, the choice is yours. You can play any of the campaign missions. New Light, for example, includes the three Destiny 2 year one legacy campaigns; The Red War, Curse of Osiris, and Warmind. Both the Forsaken and Shadowkeep campaigns are currently still expansions that you’ll need to shell out for. Upon purchasing any of the expansions, (Shadowkeep, Forsaken, New Light, or The Witch Queen), you gain access to a whole new chunk of the Destiny 2 storyline. While you can access any of them at any time, I would highly recommend doing them in that order, once you've finished the base campaign of course. Campaign missions grant you cool rewards, and help a lot with boosting your power level.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Crucible</button>

                <img src="images/cruciblepic.png">
            </div>
            <h1>Crucible</h1>
            <p>The Crucible is a competitive player-vs-player (PvP) multiplayer activity in Destiny 2. Players can earn loot by completing Crucible matches.[1] However, in order to be eligible for rewards, a player must have obtained at least one kill. In most playlists, Light and Power advantages are disabled, so all players have a chance regardless of their or their opponents' levels. However, there is a Crucible rank, which goes up only if you play Crucible. It allows you to unlock cool rewards from Lord Shaxx, who heads all Crucible activities.</p>
            <p>The Crucible offers multiple different game modes. Here's a quick breakdown of the main ones:
            </p>
            <h2>Control</h2>
            <p>This game mode is centered around zone control. Upon spawning in, one can notice that there are three zones (A, B, and C). It is the two opposing teams' goal to capture all three zones at once so that they may gain what's called a "power play". Whilst a power play is active, kills by your team have an increased score for your team. Essentially, the goal of this game mode is to kill the opposing team, but capturing all of the zones and then killing the opposition grants your team more points.</p>
            <h2>Rumble</h2>
            <p>Rumble is a fairly easy to understand game mode. It is a six player free-for-all, meaning there are no teams, and you must kill anyone you see. The goal of Rumble is to be the first to reach 2,500 points. Each kill is 100 points, plus another 50 if you kill whoever's in first place.</p>
            <h2>Survival</h2>
            <p>Survival is different because rather than bringing up your Crucible rank, it brings up your Glory rank. Your Glory rank is a competitive ranking system, meaning it can go up or down based on your performance in Survival, and it also matches you with similarly ranked players. The better you perform, the tougher the opposition will be. Regarding the game mode itself, Survival is a 3-on-3 team deathmatch, and each team only gets 4 respawns per round. The first team to win 4 rounds wins the match.</p>
            <h2>Iron Banner</h2>
            <p>Iron Banner is a similar game mode to Control with a few little differences. It is a monthly week-long event, and in it, your power level matters. If you have a higher power level, you can deal more damage and take less. If you are of a lower power level, you deal less damage and are more susceptible to it. Furthermore, rather than the power play, there is "the hunt". When a team captures all three zones, those zones lock for a short period, and kills by that team grant significantly more points. Iron Banner puts a much heavier emphasis on capturing the zones.
            </p>
            <h2>Trials of Osiris</h2>
            <p>Trials of Osiris is very similar to Survival, but it is much more competitive. It is only available on the weekends, and players must have reached a certain power level to gain access to it. Trials also has its own ranking system, giving you Trials-exclusive rewards as you rank up. Once you reach that power level, you have to talk to Saint-14, the officiator of Trials, and obtain Trials Passage. Those passages track your wins, and if you get 7 wins straight, you have gone "flawless", which grants you access to the Lighthouse. The Lighthouse has a chest that you can open to get some sick rewards, including that week's "adept" weapon. There are 4 different types of Trials Passages:</p>
            <p>Passage of Mercy - forgives one loss per run.</p>
            <p>Passage of Ferocity - grants a bonus win if you get your first three without losing.</p>
            <p>Passage of Confidence - gives you bonus rewards from the flawless chest in the Lighthouse.</p>
            <p>Passage of Wealth - increases Trials rank points every 3rd, 5th, and 7th win.</p>
            <h2>Others</h2>
            <p>There are a few other modes that rotate every week, and they're pretty self-explanatory. They are less played than the others, and they all bring up your Crucible rank. I highly recommend checking them out, but they'll get old pretty quick.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Strikes</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="image-campaign">
                <img src="images/strikespic.jpg">
            </div>
            <h1>Strikes</h1>
            <p>A Strike is a cooperative activity available in Destiny and Destiny 2. A Strike is a structured, progressive, cooperative adventure ideal for pick-up groups or friends looking for a quick battle together. Strikes are replayable, designed for three-person Fireteams, and usually take 20–45 minutes to complete. They generally consist of a short journey where you battle hordes of enemies, and eventually a final boss.</p>
            <h2>Nightfall</h2>
            <p>Each week, players have access to a new Nightfall strike. This strike is of higher difficulty, and offers greater rewards. You can change the difficulty of these strikes based on your power level. For the best of players, the game offers the Grandmaster Nightfall. This is the most difficult activity in the game, and I do not recommend trying it unless you are of the recommended light level and know what you're doing.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Gambit</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="image-campaign">
                <img src="images/gambitpic.jpg">
            </div>
            <h1>Gambit</h1>
            <p>Gambit is overseen by The Drifter, who provides commentary and organizes matches. At the start of the match, The Drifter flips a coin to determine which enemies will spawn. Fallen, Scorn, Hive, Vex, and Cabal can be used in various rounds. When killed, enemies drop motes that are cashed into the team's central bank.  Majors can occasionally spawn and will drop more motes when killed. When a team turns in 5 motes, they spawn a small blocker enemy for the enemy team. When 10 motes are turned in, a medium block enemy is sent to the enemy team. When 15 motes are turned in, a large blocker enemy is sent to the enemy team. When a team deposits 25 motes, they can send one team member over to the other team's arena. The invading player takes on the form of a red specter and is buffed with increased stats. Once a team reaches 100 motes, they can summon a Primeval boss that must be killed to win the match. Teams can still invade each other while in the Primeval fight. If a team member dies from a guardian kill during this fight, the Primeval heals damage.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Raids</button>
        <div class="panel">
            <div class="images-campaign">
                <img src="images/raidspic.jpg">
            </div>
            <h1>Raids</h1>
            <p>Raids are a six-player cooperative activity. Raids are very difficult and complex, requiring communication and high-level abilities and gear. Unlike story missions and strikes, raids give players only the bare minimum of guidance and objectives and instead challenge Guardians to figure everything out as they proceed. Because of the necessity of communication and coordination, raids do not support matchmaking. Because of their intense difficulty and heavy time commitment, raids offer some very powerful and exclusive rewards. Furthermore, each one has its own special exotic weapon that has a very low chance of dropping upon completion. These weapons are generally very good in both PVE and PVP.</p>

            <h1>Other Activities</h1>
            <p>Aside from the previously listed activities, there are many other smaller activities you can take part in. Those include, but are not limited to, public events, seasonal challenges, dungeons, battlegrounds, and much, much more! All of these activities yield different rewards, and can be completed as often as they appear.</p>
